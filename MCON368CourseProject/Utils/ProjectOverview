Project Overview
The Yeshiva management system will consist of the following main components:

Student Management
Shiur Management
Rebbe Management
Stats Module

The result should be a console application written is C# that has a series of menus representing the various components, and the choices that a user would be able to make. (Extra credit will be given if a GUI application is turned in instead).
