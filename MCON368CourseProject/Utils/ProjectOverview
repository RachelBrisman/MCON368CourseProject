Project Overview
The Yeshiva management system will consist of the following main components:

Student Management
Shiur Management
Rebbe Management
Stats Module

The result should be a console application written is C# that has a series of menus representing the various components, and the choices that a user would be able to make. (Extra credit will be given if a GUI application is turned in instead).
You must connect to a real database system and use LINQ queries to extract the data and put in the data.


Student Management - Students will build a module to manage student information, including:
* Adding, updating, and deleting student records
- Searching for students by name and ID
* Displaying student details, including their enrolled Shiurim.

Shiur Management - Students will develop a module for managing Shiur information, including:
* Adding, updating, and deleting Shiur records
- Assigning Rebbeim to Shiurim
- Enrolling and unenrolling students in Shiurim
* Displaying Shiur details, including enrolled students and assigned Rebbeim

Rebbe Management - Students will create a module for managing Rebbe information, including:
* Adding, updating, and deleting Rebbe records
- Assigning Shiurim to Rebbeim
* Displaying Rebbe details, including their assigned Shiurim

Stats Module - Students will need to provide a Stats module to summarize various data in the database, including:
- Number of students enrolled in each Shiur
- Number of students per Rebbe
* Total number of Shiurim offered by the Yeshiva
